⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that Python's name was inspired by the British comedy series "Monty Python's Flying Circus"? 
             Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python, was a fan of the show, 
             and when he needed a name for his programming language,
             he decided to choose something that was short, unique, 
             and slightly mysterious. 
             Thus, Python was born, and its playful and humorous origins continue to resonate with developers worldwide!
